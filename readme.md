## 2025 - Master in Data Science and Statistical Learning (second level)
This work explores Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using inertial data from smartphone accelerometers and gyroscopes. 
The approach evaluates both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to encode motion sequences into embedding vectors, classified through a multilayer perceptron (MLP). 
The architecture is extended to a federated learning setup using the Flower library, enabling decentralized training across devices without transferring user data. 
This strategy addresses challenges of user heterogeneity and enhances data privacy compared to centralized training. 
The proposed approach was evaluated on the DAGHAR benchmark dataset.

## 2008 - PhD in Computer Engineering, Multimedia and Telecommunications
This study investigates robust algorithms for estimating parametric transformations, focusing on warping techniques. 
The methods are applied to the 3D reconstruction of objects from planar laser scanner data acquired by a camera as the object moves on a turntable. 
Accurate camera calibration relyes on robust fit of the warping planar harmonic homology related to the virtual Solid of Revolution generated by a scene element in circular motion. 
In a separate scenario, the thesis tackles eye-gaze estimation for motor-impaired users, using a single camera. 
Eye tracking is performed by robustly fitting ellipses to iris contours, and gaze direction is estimated via a robust warping between the camera image and the display plane.

## 2004 - Master Degree in Computer Engineering (5 years)
This thesis develops algorithms for the automatic 3D reconstruction of Solids of Revolution (SORs) from a single uncalibrated image. 
Overcoming limitations of manual methods, the work focuses on automatic segmentation of key SOR features, i.e. apparent contour and ellipses, 
by exploiting the planar homology that relates the two imaged sides of the SOR with respect to the axis of symmetry, and filtering distractors through curve analysis. 
The goal is to autonomously estimate camera parameters and reconstruct the object's metric shape.
